# Introduction

When I started learning Dutch I couldn't find **R project** which will support my vocabulary memorization. So I started myself virtual `r newthought('flashcards')`^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard)] project in Shiny. What is absurd, my goal is I don't need them any more in a nearly future. Maybe someone else **vindt het leuk**.

# The data

Vocabulary covers material from `r newthought('De opmaat, Naar NT2-niveau A2')`^[[De opmaat, Naar NT2-niveau A2](https://www.nt2.nl/en/100-37_De-opmaat)] and is stored in JSON file. I'm also continuously enlarging the dataset.

```{r De opmat, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "The book cover page. Source: https://www.nt2.nl/ ", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=7, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./3d_-_9789085067238_-_omslag_-_de_opmaat_es.png")
```

The reason why I have chosen *JSON* in favour of *CSV* is that I'm using *list* data type to store *Worden* (more then one translation) and *Thema* number (one word can appear with a different context more then once). The structure is:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
wordlist <- fromJSON(txt = "./App/wordlist.json")
objects <- wordlist[1:3,]
text <- toJSON(objects, pretty = T)
print(text)
```

An disadvantage of this approach is data frames are not sortable.

At this moment I'm using Polish translations only for supportive reason.


# The application

The Shiny Application sources are available from my `r newthought('Github repository')`^[[https://github.com/JacekPardyak/FC](https://github.com/JacekPardyak/FC)]. The usage is straightforward. 


# Further work

Further I can improve the momorization process with `r newthought('Leitner System')`^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)].

Probably add more languages.

And of course B1 course vocabulary.
